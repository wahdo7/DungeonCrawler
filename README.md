# Dungeon Crawler

Behold Dungeon Crawler, the culmination of several sleepless nights of inspiration and hard work! Originally created as a project for Computer Organization and Programming at Georgia Tech (CS 2110), and thus the source code has not been uploaded here.
Dungeon Crawler is a GameBoy Advance game written in C that runs on a Mednafen emulator (https://mednafen.github.io/). Here's what you need to know...

## Emulator Controls
By default, the movement button are bound to the WASD keyboard keys. The "A" button is bound to NUMPAD 3 on the right side of the keyboard.

## The Goal
Explore the endless dungeon for as long as you can! To progess through each floor, you will need to find the trapdoor leading to the next floor, as well as the matching colored key to unlock it. Search the floor carefully to find it! Once you have it, walk up to the trapdoor to go through to the next floor.
		
## Score
Earn score by completing floors and collecting treasure. Coins can be found scattered around the dungeon, and lucky explorers may even find a valuable gem, which is worth a lot of points if you can complete the floor after finding it!

## Chests
Some items are locked away in treasure chests; you'll need to find a chest's matching colored key in order to open it. Once you have the key, walk up to the chest to open it. Chests might even contain other keys you'll need...

### Dangers
Don't let your torch burn out, or else you'll be in for a bad time! And of course, no good dungeon is without monsters, and rumor has it that this dungeon has some restless inhabitants... It should be fine, just don't let them touch you!

### Deeper and deeper...
The deeper you go, the murkier and thinner the air in the dungeon gets. Your visibility will get more obscured the deeper you progress, and your torch will start to burn out quicker as well! Be careful!

And that's about it. Prove that you are the superior spelunker by making it as deep into the dungeon as you can and spoiling yourself with ancient treasure! Just don't ask how you'll get back out...
